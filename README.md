# NoSQL: Social Network API 

## Description 

This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

Because this application has no front end, I will provide a walk through video that displays the functionality of the routes in Insomnia.
